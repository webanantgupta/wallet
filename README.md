# ðŸ¦Š MetaMask Wallet Connection App using React & ethers.js

This is a simple and clean React app that lets users connect their MetaMask wallet. Once connected, it displays the wallet address, the Ethereum network they're on, and their ETH balance. It uses **ethers.js** for interacting with the blockchain and **React Context API** to help manage the wallet state globally (useful as the app grows).

## ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack

- **React** â€“ For building the user interface
- **ethers.js** â€“ Handles Ethereum wallet connection and balance retrieval
- **Tailwind CSS** â€“ For quick and clean styling
- **React Context API** â€“ To set up a global wallet state

---

## ðŸ§  Approach (In Plain English)

### 1. `WalletCard.jsx` â€“ The Main Wallet UI
- When the user clicks **Connect Wallet**, the app asks MetaMask to connect using `eth_requestAccounts`.
- Once connected, it grabs the wallet address, current network name, and ETH balance using `ethers.js`.
- These details are stored in local state (`useState`) and shown in a nice card layout.
- Also listens for:
  - **Account changes** â€“ If the user switches MetaMask accounts, the wallet reconnects automatically.
  - **Chain/network changes** â€“ If the user switches networks, the app reloads to stay updated.

### 2. `WalletContext.js` â€“ Global Wallet State
- Even though it's not used in `WalletCard` yet, Iâ€™ve already added a context setup with `createContext` and `useContext`.
- This is a great starting point for managing wallet data across multiple components if the app grows bigger later.

### 3. `App.js` â€“ Main App Setup
- It wraps everything inside `WalletProvider`, so the context is available.
- The wallet UI is centered using Tailwind utility classes.

## ðŸ§ª A Few Assumptions

- The user already has MetaMask installed in their browser.
- It only works with **Ethereum-compatible** networks (for now).
- The app is opened in a modern browser that supports `window.ethereum`.
